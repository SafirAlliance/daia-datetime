Following are relevant posts from the Safìr Alliance Discord server:

> A day on Daia is 72'000 s, or 20 hr, long; it is divided into sixteen *natai* (sg. *nata*). A nata is divided into 72 *qarenaw* (sg. qaren), and a *qaren* is divided further into 72 *đagiai* (sg. *đagia*), matching the ideal safir resting heart rate of 69·12 bpm.
> 
> Above a day, the next timekeeping period is a *kateme*, a rather informal period of nine or ten days. Above that is the second, rarer, definition of *vàtaře*, which refers to a period of 40 days.
> 
> After that is the Daian year, equivalent to 549 local days (457·5 Terran days; 1·25 Terran years). 

> Then there is the Daian calendar, which is fairly unique, by human standards, in its operation.
> 
> It eschews weeks and months, instead having two “wheels”: one 429 days (357·5 Terran days; the idealized safir gestation period) and one 549 days. The former names days by numbering them 1-33 and naming them after thirteen precious gems. In order:
> 
> - Mau (ruby)
> - Lòđríř (zircon)
> - Áradî (garnet)
> - Nenálû (opal)
> - Rŷmňû (onyx)
> - Řalídam (turquoise)
> - Kànâja (demantoid)
> - Térezî (deep cryst)
> - Volánsikhai (amber)
> - Kuja (beryl)
> - Còwì (topaz)
> - Neital (emerald)
> - Súvâri (amethyst)

> The 549-day wheel names days by numbering them 1-61 and naming them after nine colors, as follows:
> 
> - Sajúmas (brown)
> - Cavartûs (yellow)
> - Âfełaris (green)
> - Mátsunas (black)
> - Basîres (pink)
> - Menaós (dark blue)
> - Ìtreus (orange)
> - Ávris (red)
> - Îceilis (purple)

> No day name repeats for 143 Daian years; this is the far more common use of vàtaře, which lends itself to year numbering. Years are numbered based on their cycle and position within. 

> The words used for the first day of a given year also label that year within the cycle. For example, year 1 will always be the Year of the Brown Ruby (*Mau Sajúmo*).
